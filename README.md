So, my sis operates a parfait business and I decided to put my web skills to work.
This project is a web app built with flask(a python backend framework).
Some of its features include: a page where you can place your order, when you place the order, a confirmation mail is sent to the email
address entered on the form then you would need to click the link to show that you are that you are the real owner of the email address provided.
Then finally, the whole information about nhe order gets stored on the database
(The database is built with sqlalchemy(a python database framework))
